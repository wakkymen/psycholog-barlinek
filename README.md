This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Now it is onlyfew mainly decorational components rendering fetched static data. My aim is to develop simple and working cms solution for static pages with intention on hosting these on AWS. Admin panel and backend will be developed in separate repositories.
TODO: add links to other repos to readme, create Article component, caching, refactoring css into probably css-modules.
